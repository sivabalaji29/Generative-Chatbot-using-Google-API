# Generative-Chatbot-using-Google-API


Description

This repository contains the code for a chatbot built using generative AI and powered by Google's API. The chatbot is capable of engaging in conversations, generating text responses based on user input, and learning from interactions over time. It utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to provide meaningful and contextually relevant responses.

To interact with the chatbot, simply run the chatbot.py script and follow the prompts. The chatbot will initiate conversations, respond to queries, and attempt to simulate human-like interactions. The underlying model leverages Google's AI capabilities to generate text based on the input it receives.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the potential of generative AI for creating intelligent conversational agents. While the chatbot's responses may vary in accuracy and coherence, it serves as a proof of concept for leveraging machine learning APIs to build interactive applications.

Future improvements could include refining the model's training data, enhancing the chatbot's ability to handle a wider range of topics, and integrating additional AI technologies for more sophisticated interactions. Overall, this project showcases the exciting possibilities of AI-powered chatbots and invites contributions from the developer community to further enhance its capabilities.
